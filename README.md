# Huffman-Coding-Algorithm-for-Text-Compression-and-Decompression-in-CPP
This code provides an implementation of Huffman Coding using C++. It enables efficient text compression and decompression through frequency-based encoding, constructing a Huffman Tree, assigning variable-length codes, and translating text to and from its binary representation.
